F5XC can provide additional capabilities by expanding the F5XC directly into the customer datacenter.  
This is done by installing an VM/Baremetal device, F5XC Customer Edge ( CE ) in the datacenter.
This provides multiple unique capabilities:  
* Load balancing the traffic directly to the real servers with no need to expose them to the internet 
* Send the traffic directly to the onprem F5XC CE which is fully managed from the cloud
* Create a private network between datacenters and allow applications to communicate with each other
* Many many more
